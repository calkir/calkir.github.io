            With the passage of the 13th amendment, over 200 years of slavery in the 
            United States came to an end, freeing nearly 4 million enslaved 
            African Americans but leaving them with few opportunities to support themselves. 
            Over the next 10 years, the federal government embarked upon a project known 
            as "Reconstruction," in which it imposed massive institutional 
            reform across the South to incorporate the newly freed population into 
            American society.
        </p>
        <p>
            One central component on Reconsturction was the Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company, 
            commonly referred to as the Freedman’s Bank. After being signed into law 
            by President Lincoln in 1865, the Bank operated as a private corporation 
            dedicated to empowering African Americans to achieve financial stability and 
            independence. At its peak, the bank had 37 branches. Although larger 
            populations further North, such as New York City and Baltimore, held the 
            largest savings in total, the majority of branches were spread across the 
            South. Small and large accounts owned by over 70,000 account holders summed to 
            millions in savings (note: all savings in this piece are adjusted to 2025 dollars).

        <p>
            Across the 20 branches and 43,000 accounts for which the U.S. Department of 
            the Treasury has public records, there were over $53.5 million dollars 
            saved in the Freedman’s Bank in 1874. The bank itself was run by African 
            Americans employees, including at the cashier level—the top officials at each branch. 
            Each account would have been impossible to imagine 10 years earlier, and each account represented 
            a person’s investment in a brighter future for themself. There was a sense of immense
            pride associated with opening a savings account, no matter the size.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the aftermath of the Financial Panic of 1873, under poorly managed 
            investments by white trustees in Washington, this progress came 
            grinding to a halt. Under duress from drained reserves after multiple 
            bank runs, the Freedman’s Bank closed in June 1874. The Department of 
            the Treasury attempted to record the values of all accounts to pay them 
            out in the future, but in the end, 44% of accounts were never repaid. Over 
            just a few months, African Americans lost $3.6 million, decimating the short-lived 
            trust between African Americans and financial institutions.

            When looking at the proportion of savings lost per account across branches, 
            Beaufort, South Carolina is the clear outlier. On average, account 
            holders in Beaufort lost $3,150, far greater than any other branch. Even 
            in Macon, Alabama, one of the branches with the smallest losses per account, 
            $40 per account were lost, which was a substantial toll on the newly 
            freed African American population. After centuries of violence, this was a brutal 
            reminder of the institutional plunder of the wealth and labor of African Americans.

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Beaufort and the Port Royal Experiment</h2>
        <p>
            To understand Beaufort’s substantial losses, we must first understand its 
            history as the center of and model for Reconstruction. In November 1861, 
            at the Battle of Port Royal, the Union army drove Confederates and 
            plantation owners far inland. In the weeks that followed, formerly enslaved 
            African Americans took control of the region. They began to work for 
            wages under a Treasury Department program designed to produce goods for 
            the Union army, referred to today as the Port Royal Experiment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When plantation labor was compensated with wages, a regional economy began to 
            take shape with the creation of local businesses and different forms of 
            employment, such as drivers, cooks, and nurses. General Hunter, against the 
            wishes of the federal government, issued a local emancipation 
            proclamation and set up a regiment of African American soldiers. 
            Later, the service of African Americans would be one of the primary 
            justifications for extending citizenship. By the spring of 1862, 
            abolitionist educators from the north arrived in Beaufort to set up schools, 
            which served as a model for schools setup by the Freedman’s Bureau across 
            the South after the war. The Beaufort District Tax Auctions began in 1863, 
            and formerly enslaved folks began to buy small parcels of land, many of 
            which were located on the same plantations to which they had been enslaved. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Beaufort and the broader Sea Islands region began the process of 
            empowering African Americans five years before the rest of the South. 
            By 1874, the additional half decade of progress was reflected in the 
            abnormally high savings, but it was also reflected by catastrophic losses. The 
            failures of the Reconstruction era hit especially hard in the regions that had most 
            benefited from its successes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of the almost 1,000 open accounts in Beaufort, around 400 lost their 
            savings forever. The high losses per account were primarily driven 
            by two unknown accounts: Account #144, valued at $56,105, and Account 
            #375, valued at $330,131. It is difficult to know much about the account 
            holder for certain, but it is possible it belonged to 
            <a href=”https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-smalls.htm”>Robert Smalls</a>, 
            a war hero and Reconstruction era politician that became famous for purchasing 
            the entire mansion and property of Henry McKee, who had once enslaved him. 
            The 1870 Census put his family net worth at around $200,000, far greater 
            than any other account in the region and making him a plausible candidate for 
            the owner of Account #375. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if the two unknown account holders drove the difference between 
            Beaufort and other branches, each loss was a substantial setback to a 
            real person trying to build a life for themselves and their families. 
            The Reconstruction reforms and backsliding can feel abstract or distant, 
            but it is important to remember that it had tangible impacts on real 
            Americans. 
        </p>
        <p>Consider Emma Thomas, who was born in 1855 or 1856 in Pickens, 
            South Carolina, much farther inland than Beaufort. Growing up so distantly 
            from the coast, Emma would not have been affected by the Port Royal 
            Experiment during the early 1860s. However, by 1870, she had moved to 
            Laurens County, South Carolina, and opened an account at the Freedman Bank 
            in Beaufort, allowing her to build wealth and plan her future. By 1874, 
            she had amassed $13,050. She was one of the biggest account holders in 
            Beaufort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emma Thomas was also one of the 17,734 account holders in the public 
            records that never recovered the money she had saved. Even in the face of adversity, 
            Emma did not let the failure of the state determine her future. In 1875, she married 
            John Marion Nations, and they had at least 6 sons and 6 daughters, eventually 
            moving back to Pickens. At the age of 64, on Valentine’s Day in 1920 (Feb 14), 
            she passed away.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Emma still rests in Pickens today. Similarly to many account holders, her 
            bank records are one of the primary ways for her ancestors to trace their family 
            lineage. As academics and government officials digitize and catalogue buried 
            records from our history, it becomes the responsibility of historians and everyday 
            people to use the tools at our disposal to humanize our history and connect it to 
            our present.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I reflect on the details I uncovered about Beaufort and the Freedman’s Bank, I am 
            reminded that the radical progress and institutional changes during Reconstruction 
            occurred within only 10 years. I am reminded how quickly that progress was undone 
            during a period of financial crisis. And more than anything, I am reminded that the 
            lives of real people, like Emma, were irreversibly altered by these events. Historical 
            data, even when small or incomplete, is a window into the lives of people with 
            stories that are worth knowing.
